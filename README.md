**About This Website**

Hello, my name is Rom Vireak. I am currently studying Computer Science at the Royal University of Phnom Penh.

This website is a project for my PHP course in the Web Development class.

The goal of this website is to provide a free book-sharing platform where users can:

* Download books and documents for free
* Upload and share their own books or documents with others

This project was built using HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, and Bootstrap.
